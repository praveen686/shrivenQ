# ShrivenQuant Deployment Configuration

## Environment Structure

### Development (`/dev`)
- Local development environment
- Docker Compose setup
- Mock exchange connections
- Test data generators

### Staging (`/staging`)
- Pre-production environment
- Full system integration
- Paper trading connections
- Performance testing

### Production (`/production`)
- Live trading environment
- Multi-region deployment
- High availability setup
- Disaster recovery

## Deployment Architecture

### Container Orchestration
```yaml
Platform: Kubernetes 1.28+
Distribution: EKS/GKE/AKS or bare-metal
Ingress: NGINX/Traefik
Service Mesh: Istio/Linkerd (optional)
```

### Infrastructure as Code
```yaml
Terraform:
  - Cloud resources provisioning
  - Network configuration
  - Security groups/firewall rules
  - Database instances

Ansible:
  - Configuration management
  - Secret rotation
  - Certificate management
```

## Deployment Pipeline

### 1. Build Stage
```bash
# Build Rust binaries
cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Build Docker images
docker build -t shrivenquant/trading-engine:$VERSION .

# Build frontend assets
npm run build --production
```

### 2. Test Stage
```bash
# Unit tests
cargo test --all

# Integration tests
pytest tests/integration/

# Performance tests
cargo bench

# Security scanning
trivy image shrivenquant/trading-engine:$VERSION
```

### 3. Deploy Stage
```bash
# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Rolling update
kubectl set image deployment/trading-engine \
  trading-engine=shrivenquant/trading-engine:$VERSION

# Health checks
kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l app=trading-engine
```

## High Availability Setup

### Multi-Region Deployment
```
Region 1 (Primary):
  - Trading Engine (Active)
  - Market Connectors
  - Primary Database
  
Region 2 (Standby):
  - Trading Engine (Standby)
  - Market Connectors
  - Read Replica

Cross-Region:
  - Global Load Balancer
  - GeoDNS routing
  - Data replication
```

### Failover Strategy
1. Health check failure detection (<5s)
2. Automatic failover to standby
3. DNS update for client routing
4. Data consistency verification
5. Incident notification

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Allocation
```yaml
Trading Engine:
  CPU: 16 cores (dedicated)
  Memory: 64GB
  Network: 10Gbps
  Storage: NVMe SSD

Market Data Service:
  CPU: 8 cores
  Memory: 32GB
  Network: 10Gbps

Risk Manager:
  CPU: 4 cores
  Memory: 16GB
```

### Kernel Tuning
```bash
# Network optimization
net.core.rmem_max = 134217728
net.core.wmem_max = 134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096 87380 134217728
net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 134217728

# CPU affinity
taskset -c 0-7 ./trading-engine
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection
- **Prometheus**: Time-series metrics
- **Grafana**: Visualization dashboards
- **VictoriaMetrics**: Long-term storage

### Logging
- **Structured Logging**: JSON format
- **ELK Stack**: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
- **Loki**: Alternative lightweight solution

### Tracing
- **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing
- **Jaeger/Zipkin**: Trace visualization

### Alerting
```yaml
Critical Alerts:
  - System down
  - Order rejection rate >1%
  - Latency >10ms
  - Position limit breach

Warning Alerts:
  - Memory usage >80%
  - Disk usage >70%
  - API rate limit approaching
```

## Security Hardening

### Network Security
- Private VPC with public/private subnets
- Security groups with minimal ports
- WAF for public endpoints
- DDoS protection

### Access Control
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access (RBAC)
- Audit logging
- Secret management (Vault/Secrets Manager)

### Compliance
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- PCI DSS compliance for payment data
- SOC 2 Type II certification
- Regular security audits
