## 🎯 Overall Progress

### Completed Sprints: 1 of 6
### Overall Completion: ~17%

## Sprint 1: Workspace & CLI ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal:** Compile a workspace that runs a no-op pipeline and prints a heartbeat  
**Status:** ✅ **100% Complete**  
**Completion Date:** 2025-08-11  

### Deliverables Completed:
- ✅ Cargo workspace structure with Rust Edition 2024
- ✅ **common** crate with core types:
  - `Symbol` - Trading instrument identifier
  - `Px` - Price type with f64 precision
  - `Qty` - Quantity type for order sizes  
  - `Ts` - Timestamp in nanoseconds
  - Full serde serialization support with bincode
- ✅ **bus** crate with lock-free channels:
  - `Message` trait for type-safe messaging
  - `Publisher`/`Subscriber` traits
  - `Bus<T>` for MPMC communication
  - `SpscChannel` for single-producer single-consumer
  - Zero-copy message passing via crossbeam
- ✅ **cli** crate with shrivenq binary:
  - `shrivenq dev up` - Runs heartbeat at configurable interval
  - `shrivenq dev ping` - Health check command
  - Structured logging with tracing
  - Async runtime with tokio

### Quality Metrics:
- **Tests:** 7 passing (2 bus, 5 common)
- **Documentation:** 100% coverage
- **Warnings:** 0
- **Dead Code:** 0
- **Performance:** Heartbeat latency < 1ms

### Bonus Deliverables:
- 🎁 **Ultra-strict build system:**
  - Zero-tolerance clippy configuration
  - Pre-compile hook script (`scripts/strict-check.sh`)
  - GitHub Actions CI pipeline
  - Forbids: unwrap(), expect(), panic!, TODO/FIXME, dead code
  - Enforces: documentation, formatting, all clippy lints

## Sprint 2: WAL & Replay Skeleton 📋 PLANNED

**Goal:** Structured WAL that can be replayed deterministically  
**Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**  
**Target Date:** TBD  

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Create `storage/` crate with append-only segmented log
- [ ] Implement `wal.append(Event)` and `wal.stream(from_ts)`
- [ ] Build `sim/replay` that reads WAL and re-emits events on bus
- [ ] Write 10K fake Tick events → replay → byte-identical timeline
- [ ] Benchmark: Target > 1M events/sec write, > 2M events/sec read

### Success Criteria:
- Deterministic replay of any session
- Zero data loss on crash
- Sub-microsecond append latency

## Sprint 3: Feed Adapters & LOB Core 📋 PLANNED

**Goal:** Parse normalized ticks from adapters and update a local L2 book  
**Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**  
**Target Date:** TBD  

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] `feed/zerodha`: WebSocket adapter with Kite Connect
- [ ] `feed/binance`: WebSocket adapter for spot/futures
- [ ] `lob/`: Price-level order book with fast updates
- [ ] Microstructure features: spread, imbalance, VPIN, micro-price
- [ ] Benchmark: LOB updates > 200k/sec, < 200ns per update

### Success Criteria:
- Real-time tick ingestion from live feeds
- Accurate book reconstruction
- Low-latency feature computation

---

## Sprint 4: Strategy Runtime & Paper Trader 📋 PLANNED

**Goal:** Run strategies and route intents to paper broker  
**Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**  
**Target Date:** TBD  

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] `strat/`: Strategy trait with `on_feature_frame`
- [ ] EchoMeanRevert example strategy
- [ ] `risk/`: Pre-trade risk checks and limits
- [ ] `om/`: Paper broker with FIFO fills
- [ ] PnL tracking and metrics

### Success Criteria:
- Strategy → Signal → Order flow working
- Risk limits enforced
- Paper fills realistic

---

## Sprint 5: Zerodha Live Integration 📋 PLANNED

**Goal:** Live ticks in, paper orders out, complete E2E loop  
**Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**  
**Target Date:** TBD  

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] Zerodha WebSocket live tick adapter
- [ ] REST API order submission (paper mode)
- [ ] Stale-book guards and safety checks
- [ ] Session timeline UI (basic web view)
- [ ] Live monitoring dashboard

### Success Criteria:
- Live market data flowing
- Paper trading operational
- UI showing real-time activity

## Sprint 6: Backtester & Feature Packs 📋 PLANNED

**Goal:** Run historical days fast with advanced features  
**Status:** ⏳ **Not Started**  
**Target Date:** TBD  

### Planned Deliverables:
- [ ] `sim/backtest`: Event-driven backtester
- [ ] Advanced features: VPIN, VWAP bands, regime detection
- [ ] Performance reports: trades, slippage, drawdowns
- [ ] Benchmark: 1 day backtest < 60s

### Success Criteria:
- Deterministic historical replay
- Accurate metrics computation
- Fast execution speed
