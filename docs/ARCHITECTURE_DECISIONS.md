# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

## ADR-001: Rust as Primary Language
**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Accepted  

### Context
Need a language that provides predictable low-latency performance, memory safety without GC pauses, and zero-cost abstractions.

### Decision
Use Rust (Edition 2024) as the primary implementation language.

### Consequences
- ✅ Predictable performance (no GC pauses)
- ✅ Memory safety guaranteed at compile time
- ✅ Zero-cost abstractions
- ✅ Excellent tooling (cargo, clippy, rustfmt)
- ⚠️ Steeper learning curve
- ⚠️ Longer initial development time

## ADR-002: Zero-Tolerance Code Quality
**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Accepted  

### Context
Trading systems require extreme reliability. Small bugs can cause significant financial losses.

### Decision
Implement zero-tolerance policy for code quality issues:
- No warnings allowed
- No dead code
- No unwrap/expect/panic
- No TODO/FIXME comments
- 100% documentation coverage

### Consequences
- ✅ Higher code reliability
- ✅ Fewer runtime failures
- ✅ Better maintainability
- ⚠️ Slower initial development
- ⚠️ More verbose code

---

## ADR-003: Lock-Free Message Passing
**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Accepted  

### Context
Need ultra-low-latency communication between components without lock contention.

### Decision
Use crossbeam channels for lock-free SPSC/MPMC communication.

### Consequences
- ✅ No lock contention
- ✅ Predictable latency
- ✅ Good throughput
- ⚠️ More complex than mutex-based approaches
- ⚠️ Requires careful design to avoid race conditions

---

## ADR-004: Event-Driven Architecture
**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Accepted  

### Context
Need to process market events with minimal latency while maintaining system modularity.

### Decision
Central event bus with publishers and subscribers. All components communicate via typed messages.

### Consequences
- ✅ Loose coupling between components
- ✅ Easy to add new components
- ✅ Natural fit for market data processing
- ⚠️ Potential for event storms
- ⚠️ Debugging can be more complex

---

## ADR-005: Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for Persistence
**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Proposed  

### Context
Need crash-safe persistence with deterministic replay capability.

### Decision
Implement append-only WAL for all events, decisions, and orders.

### Consequences
- ✅ Crash recovery
- ✅ Deterministic replay
- ✅ Audit trail
- ⚠️ Storage overhead
- ⚠️ Write latency impact

---

## ADR-006: Bincode for Hot Path Serialization
**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Accepted  

### Context
Need fast, compact serialization for internal message passing.

### Decision
Use bincode for hot path serialization, JSON for configs.

### Consequences
- ✅ Very fast serialization
- ✅ Compact binary format
- ✅ Works well with Rust types
- ⚠️ Not human-readable
- ⚠️ Version compatibility challenges

---

## ADR-007: Tokio for Async Runtime
**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Accepted  

### Context
Need async runtime for I/O operations without blocking hot path.

### Decision
Use tokio as the async runtime.

### Consequences
- ✅ Mature ecosystem
- ✅ Good performance
- ✅ Wide library support
- ⚠️ Additional complexity
- ⚠️ Potential for subtle bugs

---

## ADR-008: Monorepo with Cargo Workspaces
**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Accepted  

### Context
Need to manage multiple related components with shared dependencies.

### Decision
Use cargo workspace in a monorepo structure.

### Consequences
- ✅ Shared dependency management
- ✅ Atomic commits across components
- ✅ Easier refactoring
- ⚠️ Larger repository size
- ⚠️ Longer CI times

---

## ADR-009: GitHub Actions for CI/CD
**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Accepted  

### Context
Need automated quality checks and deployment pipeline.

### Decision
Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD with strict quality gates.

### Consequences
- ✅ Free for public repos
- ✅ Good integration with GitHub
- ✅ Easy to configure
- ⚠️ Vendor lock-in
- ⚠️ Limited customization

---

## ADR-010: Microstructure Features in LOB
**Date:** 2025-08-11  
**Status:** Proposed  

### Context
Need rich market microstructure features for alpha generation.

### Decision
Compute features (spread, imbalance, VPIN, micro-price) directly in LOB engine.

### Consequences
- ✅ Low-latency feature access
- ✅ Consistent feature computation
- ✅ Cache-friendly
- ⚠️ Increased LOB complexity
- ⚠️ Higher CPU usage

---

### Decision
What is the change that we're proposing/doing?

### Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
- ✅ Positive consequences
- ⚠️ Neutral consequences  
- ❌ Negative consequences
