## 🔴 Current Reality

**No operational procedures exist** because:
- System never deployed
- No production environment
- No monitoring setup
- No real usage data

## 📅 Timeline

Operations documentation will be created during:
- **Phase 3**: Production Preparation (Month 4-5)
- **Phase 4**: Hardening (Month 6-7)

See [Development Roadmap](../04-development/ROADMAP.md) for details.

## 🎯 Prerequisites for Operations

Before we can operate, we need:
1. ✅ Working services (partially done)
2. ❌ Integration tests
3. ❌ Error handling
4. ❌ Monitoring hooks
5. ❌ Database setup
6. ❌ Configuration management
7. ❌ Security implementation
