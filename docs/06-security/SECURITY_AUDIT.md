# 🔐 ShrivenQuant Security Audit

**Date**: 2025-01-18  
**Auditor**: CTO, ShrivenQuant  
**Classification**: CONFIDENTIAL

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 🔴 SEVERITY: CRITICAL

1. **Credential Management Improved**
   - .env and .env.example files removed
   - Secrets-manager service created with AES-256-GCM encryption
   - **ACTION**: Rotate ALL credentials that were exposed
   - **STATUS**: Secrets-manager implemented, pending integration with services

2. **Sensitive Data in JSON Files**
   - Paper trades stored in `/data/trades/paper_trades.json`
   - Sentiment signals in `/data/signals/sentiment_signals.json`
   - **ACTION**: Migrate to encrypted database
   - **STATUS**: Temporary mitigation - moved to data/ directory

### 🟡 SEVERITY: HIGH

3. **Secrets Management Service Created**
   - ✅ Secrets-manager service implemented
   - ⚠️ No HashiCorp Vault integration yet
   - ⚠️ No AWS Secrets Manager integration yet
   - **ACTION**: Integrate secrets-manager with all services

4. **Data at Rest Not Encrypted**
   - JSON files storing trading data unencrypted
   - No database encryption configured
   - **ACTION**: Enable encryption for all data storage

### 🟢 SEVERITY: MEDIUM

5. **Incomplete Access Controls**
   - No role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Missing audit logs for data access
   - **ACTION**: Implement comprehensive access control

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Step 1: Rotate All Credentials (TODAY)
```bash
# 1. Log into Zerodha Kite
# 2. Regenerate API keys
# 3. Update TOTP secret
# 4. Log into Binance
# 5. Delete existing API keys
# 6. Create new keys with IP whitelist
```

### Step 2: Implement Secrets Management (WEEK 3)
```yaml
services/secrets-manager/
├── src/
│   ├── vault_client.rs    # HashiCorp Vault integration
│   ├── encryption.rs       # AES-256 encryption
│   └── rotation.rs         # Automatic key rotation
```

### Step 3: Secure Data Storage
- Encrypt all JSON files
- Use PostgreSQL with encryption at rest
- Implement Redis with AUTH
- Enable TLS for all connections

## SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

### API Key Management
1. **NEVER** commit credentials to git
2. Use environment-specific keys
3. Rotate keys every 90 days
4. Implement key versioning
5. Use separate keys for dev/staging/prod

### Data Protection
1. Encrypt sensitive data at rest
2. Use TLS 1.3 for data in transit
3. Implement data retention policies
4. Regular security audits
5. Penetration testing quarterly

### Access Control
1. Principle of least privilege
2. Multi-factor authentication
3. Session management
4. API rate limiting
5. IP whitelisting

## COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS

### Regulatory
- **GDPR**: Data protection for EU users
- **SEBI**: Indian securities regulations
- **PCI-DSS**: If handling payments
- **SOC 2**: Security compliance

### Industry Standards
- **ISO 27001**: Information security
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**
- **CIS Controls**
- **OWASP Top 10**

## MONITORING & ALERTING

### Security Events to Monitor
1. Failed authentication attempts
2. API key usage patterns
3. Unusual trading volumes
4. Data export attempts
5. Configuration changes

### Alert Thresholds
- 5+ failed auth attempts → Alert
- API usage >1000 req/min → Alert
- Trade volume >$100K → Alert
- Bulk data export → Alert
- Credential rotation due → Alert

## INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN

### If Credentials Are Compromised:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Disable compromised keys
2. **5 MIN**: Rotate all related credentials
3. **15 MIN**: Audit recent activity
4. **30 MIN**: Notify affected users
5. **1 HR**: Complete incident report

- Emergency: [REDACTED]

## CONCLUSION

The ShrivenQuant system has strong architectural foundations but critical security vulnerabilities that must be addressed immediately. The exposed credentials represent an existential threat to the platform.

**RECOMMENDATION**: 
1. Rotate ALL credentials within 24 hours
2. Implement secrets management service in Week 3
3. Conduct full security audit monthly
4. Consider hiring dedicated security engineer
