# ShrivenQuant Next Steps - Production Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-15  
**Current Status:** 75% Complete for Production Trading  
**Timeline to Production:** 6-8 weeks (with full production hardening)  

---

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 2-3 weeks)**

### **Phase 1: Complete Service Layer**

#### **Week 1: Service Executables (High Impact, Low Effort)**
Add `main.rs` files for 5 remaining services. Business logic is complete, just need gRPC server wrappers.

**Template Pattern:**
```rust
// services/{service}/src/main.rs
use anyhow::Result;
use tonic::transport::Server;
use {service}_lib::{create_service, {Service}Server};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let service = create_service().await?;
    Server::builder()
        .add_service({Service}Server::new(service))
        .serve("[::1]:5005X".parse()?)
        .await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

**Services to Complete:**
1. **Market Connector** (`localhost:50052`)
   - Wrap existing WebSocket and exchange logic
   - gRPC service for market data streaming
   
2. **Risk Manager** (`localhost:50053`)
   - Wrap existing 526 lines of risk checks
   - gRPC service for pre-trade validation
   
3. **Execution Router** (`localhost:50054`)
   - Wrap existing 922 lines of routing logic
   - gRPC service for order management
   
4. **Portfolio Manager** (`localhost:50055`)
   - Wrap existing 462 lines of position tracking
   - gRPC service for portfolio operations
   
5. **Reporting** (`localhost:50056`)
   - Wrap existing 431 lines of analytics
   - gRPC service for metrics and reports

**Effort:** 2-3 days per service (straightforward gRPC implementation)

#### **Week 2-3: Service Integration & Testing**
1. **Inter-Service Communication**
   - Test gRPC client connections between services
   - Implement basic service discovery
   - End-to-end workflow validation

2. **Fix Test Suite**
   - Resolve compilation issues in test framework

## üéØ **RESOURCE ALLOCATION**

### **Development Priorities**
1. **Highest Priority**: Service executables (immediate unblocking)
2. **High Priority**: Service integration (end-to-end workflows)
3. **Medium Priority**: Deployment infrastructure (production readiness)
4. **Lower Priority**: Advanced features (nice-to-have)

### **Risk Mitigation**
1. **Technical Risks**: Comprehensive testing at each phase
2. **Integration Risks**: Incremental service addition
3. **Performance Risks**: Early load testing and optimization
4. **Operational Risks**: Staged production rollout

### **Key Dependencies**
1. **Service Executables**: Critical path blocker
2. **Exchange Connectivity**: Already working (Zerodha, Binance)
3. **Database Infrastructure**: Auth service shows working pattern
4. **Monitoring Tools**: Standard open-source stack

---

## üí° **RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Start Immediately**
1. **Service Executables**: Highest ROI, lowest risk
2. **Integration Testing**: Critical for production confidence
3. **Container Strategy**: Essential for deployment

### **Parallel Development**
1. **Infrastructure work** can start before all services complete
2. **Performance testing** can use subset of services
3. **Monitoring setup** can be developed independently

### **Key Success Factors**
1. **Focus on completion** over perfection
2. **Test early and often** with real data
3. **Incremental deployment** to reduce risk
4. **Comprehensive monitoring** for production confidence

## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE**

### **Health Checks Implementation**
```rust
// Each service should implement
use tonic_health::server::HealthReporter;

async fn health_check(reporter: HealthReporter) {
    loop {
        if service_healthy() {
            reporter.set_serving::<MarketDataServiceServer>().await;
        } else {
            reporter.set_not_serving::<MarketDataServiceServer>().await;
        }
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
    }
}
```

### **Prometheus Metrics**
```rust
use prometheus::{register_counter_vec, register_histogram_vec};

lazy_static! {
    static ref REQUEST_COUNTER: CounterVec = register_counter_vec!(
        "grpc_requests_total",
        "Total number of gRPC requests",
        &["service", "method", "status"]
    ).unwrap();
    
    static ref LATENCY_HISTOGRAM: HistogramVec = register_histogram_vec!(
        "grpc_request_duration_seconds",
        "gRPC request latency",
        &["service", "method"]
    ).unwrap();
}
```

### **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
```rust
struct CircuitBreaker {
    failure_threshold: u32,
    success_threshold: u32,
    timeout: Duration,
    state: Arc<RwLock<CircuitState>>,
}

enum CircuitState {
    Closed,  // Normal operation
    Open,    // Failing, reject requests
    HalfOpen // Testing recovery
}
```

### **Correlation ID Logging**
```rust
use tracing::{info_span, Instrument};

let correlation_id = Uuid::new_v4();
let span = info_span!("request", correlation_id = %correlation_id);

async move {
    info!("Processing request");
    // Service logic here
}.instrument(span).await;
```

- [ ] Distributed tracing enabled
- [ ] Load tests pass at 2x expected volume
- [ ] Disaster recovery tested

**Bottom Line**: ShrivenQuant has exceptional foundations. With these production-grade enhancements, you'll have a **world-class institutional trading platform** that meets the highest standards of reliability, observability, and performance. Timeline is 6-8 weeks for full production hardening, or 4-6 weeks for MVP with gradual hardening.
