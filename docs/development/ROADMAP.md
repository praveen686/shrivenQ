# ShrivenQuant Development Roadmap

**Last Updated:** August 18, 2025  
**Current Status:** Early Development - Core structure exists, not production-ready  
**Realistic Timeline:** 6-12 months to production  

---

## Current State

### ✅ Completed
- Basic microservices structure
- gRPC protocol definitions
- Service compilation
- Options pricing engine
- Basic authentication framework

### ❌ Major Gaps
- No exchange connectivity testing
- No backtesting capability
- No integration tests
- 134 unwrap() calls (panic points)
- No error recovery
- No monitoring
- No real data testing

- [ ] Add unit tests for critical paths
- [ ] Set up continuous integration
- [ ] Create mock exchange connections

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Weeks 5-12)
**Goal:** Implement missing core features

#### Week 5-6: Backtesting
- [ ] Complete backtesting service
- [ ] Add historical data loader
- [ ] Implement strategy framework
- [ ] Create performance metrics

#### Week 7-8: Exchange Integration

### Phase 4: Production Hardening (Weeks 21-26)
**Goal:** Battle-test the system

#### Week 21-22: Paper Trading
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run paper trading for 2 weeks
- [ ] Monitor all metrics
- [ ] Fix discovered issues

#### Week 23-24: Disaster Recovery
- [ ] Implement backup/restore
- [ ] Test failover scenarios
- [ ] Create incident response procedures
- [ ] Document recovery processes

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 2-3 Rust developers (full-time)
- 1 DevOps engineer
- 1 QA engineer

### Infrastructure
- Development environment
- Staging environment with market data
- Production-grade Kubernetes cluster
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)

### External Dependencies
- Exchange API access (test accounts)
- Historical market data
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP)

---

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- Exchange API changes
- Latency requirements not met
- Memory/resource constraints
- Regulatory compliance issues

### Mitigation Strategies
- Maintain exchange API abstractions
- Continuous performance testing
- Resource monitoring from day 1
- Early compliance review

---

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Successfully executes paper trades
- Handles 1000 orders/second
- < 10ms order latency
- 99.9% uptime in staging

### Production Ready
- 30 days of successful paper trading
- Full monitoring and alerting
- Disaster recovery tested
- Security audit passed
- Documentation complete

## Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

1. **Fix unwrap() calls** in critical services
2. **Add logging** to all services
3. **Create integration tests** for order flow
4. **Test exchange connectivity** with sandbox accounts
5. **Document current architecture** accurately

## Note on Timeline

This timeline assumes:
- Full-time dedicated development team
- No major architectural changes required
- Exchange sandbox environments available
- No regulatory blockers

Actual timeline may vary based on:
- Resource availability
- Complexity of exchange integrations
- Performance requirements
- Regulatory requirements
