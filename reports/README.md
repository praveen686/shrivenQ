## Directory Structure

```
reports/
├── benchmark/                      # Performance benchmark results
│   ├── benchmark-results.md        # Detailed analysis of benchmark results
│   └── benchmark-*.txt             # Raw benchmark output files
└── compliance/                     # Code compliance reports
    ├── compliance-report-*.txt     # Text compliance reports (generated by pre-commit)
    └── compliance-report-*.json    # JSON compliance reports (machine-readable)
```

## Benchmark Reports

The `benchmark/` directory contains:
- **benchmark-results.md** - Human-readable analysis of performance benchmarks
- **benchmark-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt** - Raw output from benchmark runs

### Latest Benchmark Results

See [benchmark-results.md](benchmark/benchmark-results.md) for the latest performance analysis.

### Running New Benchmarks

To generate a new benchmark report:

```bash
# Run full benchmark suite
cargo run --release --bin sq-perf -- all --path /tmp/perf-test

# Results are automatically saved with timestamp
```

## Compliance Reports

The `compliance/` directory contains reports automatically generated during pre-commit hooks:
- `compliance-report-{GIT_COMMIT}-{TIMESTAMP}.txt` - Full compliance check results
- `compliance-report-{GIT_COMMIT}-{TIMESTAMP}.json` - Machine-readable compliance status

These reports track:
- Code quality violations (unwrap/expect/panic usage)
- Performance anti-patterns (allocations in hot paths)
- TODO/FIXME/HACK markers
- Compliance score and recommendations

## Viewing Reports

All reports are plain text or markdown files that can be viewed with any text editor or markdown viewer.
