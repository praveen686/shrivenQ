  Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

  1. Live Trading Integration 🔴 CRITICAL

  You have the foundation, but need to connect the pieces:
  // Currently missing: The actual strategy that generates signals
  Strategy → Signal → Order → Execution

  What to build:
  - Strategy framework (crates/strategy/)
  - Signal generation from market data
  - Order management system
  - Position reconciliation

  2. Market Data → Trading Engine Connection

  Right now these are separate:
  Market Data (feeds/) ---❌---> Trading Engine (engine/)

  Need to connect them:
  // Create the event flow
  WebSocket → Event Bus → Engine → Orders

  3. Paper Trading Mode 📝

  Before risking real money:
  - Implement full paper trading simulation
  - Track virtual P&L
  - Test your strategies safely
  - Validate risk management

  Next Sprint Priority (Weeks 1-2)

  Sprint 4: Strategy Runtime

  crates/
  ├── strategy/
  │   ├── src/
  │   │   ├── lib.rs         // Strategy trait
  │   │   ├── signals.rs     // Signal generation
  │   │   ├── indicators.rs  // Technical indicators
  │   │   └── examples/
  │   │       ├── mean_reversion.rs
  │   │       └── momentum.rs

  Key tasks:
  1. Define Strategy trait
  2. Implement basic strategies
  3. Connect to market data feed
  4. Generate trading signals
  5. Integrate with execution engine

  Technical Debt to Address

  1. Missing Core Functionality

  # These exist but aren't connected:
  ✅ Market data feeds
  ✅ Trading engine
  ✅ Risk management
  ❌ Strategy framework  # BUILD THIS
  ❌ Order management   # BUILD THIS
  ❌ Live execution     # BUILD THIS

  2. Production Readiness

  - Add monitoring/metrics dashboard
  - Implement alerting system
  - Create operational runbooks
  - Set up log aggregation

  3. Testing Gaps

  - Add strategy backtesting
  - Historical data replay
  - Stress testing
  - Failure scenario testing

  My Recommendation: Next 48 Hours

  Day 1: Create Basic Strategy Framework

  # 1. Create strategy module
  cargo new --lib crates/strategy

  # 2. Implement basic mean reversion strategy
  # 3. Connect market data to strategy
  # 4. Generate first trading signal

  Day 2: Connect Everything

  # 1. Wire strategy → engine
  # 2. Test paper trading mode
  # 3. Verify order flow works
  # 4. Run live paper trading test

  The Big Picture Roadmap

  Current State (Week 0)
  ├── ✅ Infrastructure ready
  ├── ✅ Market data working
  ├── ✅ Engine built
  └── ❌ No strategies

  Week 1-2: Strategy Framework
  ├── Build strategy system
  ├── Create 2-3 basic strategies
  └── Paper trading working

  Week 3-4: Live Trading Prep
  ├── Real order management
  ├── Position reconciliation
  ├── Live monitoring
  └── Emergency stops

  Week 5-6: Go Live (Carefully!)
  ├── Start with tiny positions
  ├── Monitor everything
  ├── Iterate on strategies
  └── Scale gradually

  Specific Next Actions

  Option A: Build Strategy Framework (Recommended)

  cd /home/praveen/ShrivenQuant
  cargo new --lib crates/strategy
  # Then implement basic strategy

  Option B: Create Integration Tests

  # Test the full flow: data → engine → orders
  cargo test --package integration_tests

  Option C: Deploy Paper Trading

  # Set up paper trading environment
  ./scripts/deploy/local-deploy.sh test
  # Run with paper trading mode

  Option D: Implement Monitoring

  # Add Prometheus metrics
  # Create Grafana dashboards
  # Set up alerts

  Questions to Answer First

  1. What's your trading strategy?
    - Mean reversion?
    - Momentum?
    - Arbitrage?
    - Market making?
  2. Which market first?
    - NSE/BSE stocks?
    - Crypto?
    - Both?
  3. Risk parameters?
    - Max position size?
    - Daily loss limit?
    - Number of concurrent positions?

  My Strong Recommendation
  
  Build a simple strategy and test it in paper mode ASAP!

  Would you like me to:
  1. Create a basic strategy framework with a simple mean reversion strategy?
  2. Set up paper trading mode so you can test safely?
  3. Create integration that connects market data → strategy → engine?
  4. Build a monitoring dashboard to track your system?

  Which would be most valuable for you right now?
